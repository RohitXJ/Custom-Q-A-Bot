Talking about your daily routine, do you have any specific time for meals? Are you a breakfast person, or do you prefer brunch? Knowing your routine helps me provide timely suggestions and reminders. Music preferences are also fun to discuss.',\n",
       " 40: \"What genre of music do you like? I can help you find new artists or playlists based on your taste. Are you learning something new? Perhaps a language, a programming skill, or a musical instrument? I can help track your progress and suggest resources. Mental health is just as important as physical health. Do you practice meditation or mindfulness? I can guide you through some techniques or remind you to take moments for yourself. Let's not forget about your goals. What are some short-term and long-term goals you want to achieve? Having clear goals helps in planning and tracking progress.\",\n",
       " 41: 'Do you have any pets? Pets are wonderful companions, and I can remind you about feeding times or vet appointments. If you like shopping, I can help you keep track of your expenses and create shopping lists. Lastly, staying informed is important. Are you interested in news updates, sports scores, or tech advancements? I can provide summaries based on your interests. Feel free to tell me more about yourself, and I will adapt to assist you better. This sample text aims to cover a variety of topics an AI assistant should know or ask about to personalize interactions effectively. Thank',\n",
